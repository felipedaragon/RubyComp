# RubyComp

A fork of RubyComp, a Delphi component for embedding the Ruby interpreter.

This modification has been updated for Delphi XE2 or higher and adds 64-bit support. It still compiles and works with the older, non-Unicode Delphi releases.

The C wrapper functions are based on [Appollo](http://www.moriq.com/apollo/) and written by Kazuhiro Yoshida.

RubyComp was created by Pirmin Kalberer ([@pka](https://github.com/pka)) and was originally hosted at http://pro.sourcepole.ch/projects/rubycomp/
