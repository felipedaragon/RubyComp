# RubyComp

A fork of RubyComp, a Delphi component for embedding the Ruby interpreter, with some minor improvements.

The C wrapper functions are based on [Appollo](http://www.moriq.com/apollo/) and written by Kazuhiro Yoshida.

RubyComp was created by Pirmin Kalberer (Sourcepole AG) and was originally hosted at http://pro.sourcepole.ch/projects/rubycomp/
